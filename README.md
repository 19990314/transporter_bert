BERT-Based Annotation of Brain-Specific Transporter Activities & Gene-Gene Interactions
This project aims to detect transporter activities across different organ cells (brain, liver, lung, etc.), with a primary focus on brain-specific transporters involved in neurodegenerative pathways such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) and glymphatic filtration. 
The approach is inspired by scBERT, utilizing self-supervised learning followed by fine-tuning to accurately annotate transporters and later using large language models (LLMs) to explore gene-gene interactions.
